This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

This template's architecture is based off of the
following: https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-app-architecture-riverpod-introduction/

Template relies on Riverpod and is utilising its auto-generation for providers feature. To learn
